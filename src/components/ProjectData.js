      description: "In this project, I built a visual editor using JavaFX to create a state‐machine diagram editor with multiple synchronized views. The editor includes a tool palette that allows users to create state nodes, connect states with transition links, move and edit items in the workspace, and pan the view. A property panel on the right‐hand side of the screen enables users to edit details for a state node or a transition link, while pressing the Delete key removes the selected item and any dependent items. The project covered immediate‐mode graphics, interaction with graphics, more complex model‐view‐controller architectures, and demonstrated my skills in full‐stack development, algorithms, and software engineering.",

The project was carried out in stages, including brainstorming the app idea, sketching possible interfaces, refining the system using heuristic evaluation, creating a refined medium fidelity prototype in Figma, and testing the prototype with potential users to suggest future improvements. Through this project, I demonstrated a sound understanding of UI/UX concepts and the ability to ideate, design, and test a functional app. ",

        title: "REST vs SOAP app",
        description: "This project involved building two chatroom applications using different API technologies, REST and SOAP. The apps allow users to create chatrooms, list existing rooms, join and leave chatrooms, and display previously sent messages with a maximum delay of 1.5 seconds for new messages. The REST app was built using Flask and C# as the client, while the SOAP app was built using C# as the server and client. Both apps required Docker to set up and run. The main goal of this project was to conduct a profiling experiment that involved testing and comparing the performance of these two chatroom applications and determine which API technology was ideal to use in what scenario. It was concluded that Apps where performance is a major concern such as web browsing, social media, chat apps etc. REST seems to be a better fit for such purposes due to its light‐weight nature and faster response times, whereas SOAP shines in Security, Reliability and failure handling, and such systems where these factors are immensely important such as Financial, Payment Gateways, Telecommunication. SOAP would be a better fit. This project demonstrated proficiency in API technologies, client‐server architecture, containerization, Profiling.",
